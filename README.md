addR
This is a Python script that uses a simple algorithm to find the best combinations of numbers that add up to a given target number. It also has a graphical user interface that allows you to enter the numbers and the target number and see the results.

Requirements
•  Python 3.x

•  tkinter module (usually comes with Python installation)

•  itertools module (usually comes with Python installation)

Usage
•  Run the script (python addR.py)

•  Enter the numbers separated by commas in the first input field (e.g. 1,2,3,4,5)

•  Enter the target number in the second input field (e.g. 10)

•  Click the "Izračunaj" button to calculate the best combinations

•  Check the results in the text area below. The results will show the combinations, their sums, and their differences from the target number. The combinations are sorted by their differences in ascending order. The best combinations are those with the smallest difference.

Why? I work in a tiny company and I made this so we can easily calculate which pieces of goods we need to write off up to a certain targeted number.
